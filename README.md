# Automate the MacOS stuff

This repository contains **scripts** that automate the setup of a new macbook.

PS: you can find also a [Guide](GUIDE.md) to do it manually if you prefer

These scripts will automate the following:

- The installation of the Command Line Tools

- The installation of the 3rd party applications

- The configuration of System/Apps preferences
